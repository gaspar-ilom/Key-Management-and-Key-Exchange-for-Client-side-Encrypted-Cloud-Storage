# Abstract
Cloud storage systems have become very popular, rising questions about the security of the data shared in the cloud. This thesis presents a secure cloud storage system, that uses client-side encryption to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the data in the cloud. It proposes a cryptographic tree structure that enables efficient and secure sharing of the data by using hybrid encryption. The cloud storage provider runs a Public Key Infrastructure, so that the user can easily retrieve other users' public keys to share data with them. To avoid putting too much trust in the cloud storage provider two certificate verification mechanisms are introduced: QR-Code verification and verification via the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol, which can be performed over a potentially insecure channel. In order to add further devices to one's account or recover from a device loss the user's private key is stored in the cloud encrypted with a random generated 12 English words passphrase. The feasibility of the presented design is evidenced by a proof of concept implementation and an evaluation.
